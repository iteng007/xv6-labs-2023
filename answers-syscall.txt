Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?

usertrap() in kernel/trap.c

What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)

p->trapframe->a7==0x7
it represents the system call number for the system call exec

What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?

Previous mode was user mode since the trapframe->sstatus is 0x22, which the 8th bit is 1, which means the previous mode is user mode.
(The SPP bit indicates the privilege level at which a hart was executing before entering supervisor
mode.)

Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)

0x0-0x1000 are unused in physical memory, and it also no mapping in virtual memory. So the kernel crash.
It's confirmed by the scause register which value is 0xd,13 in hex, which means `Load page fault`.

What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?

If the question is asking the name of the binary that was running 'before' the kernel paniced, it's initcode which pid is 2.
