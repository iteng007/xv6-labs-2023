Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a2

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
The call to g is inlined in f, so there is no explicit call to g in f's assembly code.
The call to f (which already includes g due to inlining) is also inlined in main, so there is no explicit call to f in main's assembly code.

At what address is the function printf located?\
642

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
38

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
He110 World

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
I guess it should be:4321.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
I think it just take the arbitary value in register a2
